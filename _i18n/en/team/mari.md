Mari-Riin Villemsoo, young and filled with sun, is currently studying 
lighting design at University of Tartu Viljandi Culture Academy at 
the Performing Arts Visual Technology department. She is also a lighting technician for Ugala Theatre.

She has been working in the field for about five years and has grown 
with Tilt since the first festival in 2013. Improv found Mari-Riin and she found improv, through 
the main organizer Rahel and soon they started IMPROving the collaboration 
between actors and technicians.
 
Though working in a classical theatre and with improv is in a way similar, 
there are many factors that play much bigger role in improv show for her
as a lighting technician. Mainly, she likes the feeling of “really being 
on the spot” while doing the shows, because in improv she can play together 
with the actors and have so much bigger impact on the show!

In addition to the festival TILT, she has worked in several bigger 
theatres in Estonia and done many designs for shows (drama, dance, concerts ect.)
