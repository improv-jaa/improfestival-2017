Maria likes to try new things. So it is only logical that next to 
having a thousand different hobbies, she finally ended up doing improv.

After trying it once, she was hooked. Having participated in Tilt for 
two years as a performer and an audience member, she could not sit 
still any more and wanted to be a part of the magic of organising the 
festival. Maria has now been a part of the festival team for two years.
