Rahel has had the honour of organizing Tilt for the past five years.

She has been leading the Jaa !mprov theatre a few years longer, and has 
discovered that anything related to improv gets attached to her rather 
easily. Rahel likes improv for the spontaneous energy and endless 
possibilities that it provides. And of course, the people!

In addition to improv she has also been doing classical theatre and 
the theatre of the oppressed and in addition to Tilt, she has been 
organizing various other events. She also belongs to the Association of 
Professional Arts and Cultural Managers of Estonia. You will recognize
 her by her curly hair, fast talk and loud laughter.
