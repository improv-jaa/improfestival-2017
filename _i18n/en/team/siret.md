Siret has her first year with Tilt, but she has beena great
friend with improv for much longer.

She seems to like multitasking and is a very colorful person
who has clad herself in many different coats and juggles
every day with extremely adversarial activities.

Since Siret is a social butterfly and pretty good at
communications, we decided to give her full command
over our social media.

If you hear someone humming some tune anywhere,
then it's probably Siret.
