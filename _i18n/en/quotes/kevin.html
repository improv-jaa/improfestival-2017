    <p>TILT was so fun. There is nothing better than meeting friends - new and old - in one of the most beautiful places in the world and spending a week learning, performing and laughing.
The people at TILT are awesome. It's a well run festival with a fantastic staff - I was well taken care of and hope to go back many times. What's better than spending a week with improvisors from around the world in a fairy tale setting. TILT is amazing.
I've been to many festivals in Europe and America and TILT is a special one. It's intimate and Tallinn casts a magical spell over all the workshops and performances. I was lucky to take part and hope to get lucky again.
