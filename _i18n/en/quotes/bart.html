        I liked everything, really. Probably it was simply the best organised improv festival I've participated in.
        From A to Z the whole experience was excellent. I also liked that the Estonian groups get a chance to perform.
        I found them enjoyable even without understanding much. Also there was a great selection of groups. High quality 
        shows and not too many mixers. I like that.
