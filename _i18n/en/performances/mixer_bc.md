### "Courtesy Sleeve". Instructor: Kaisa Kokko

**In English**

The fifth international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome
improvisers from countries nearby and far away. Because these participants
are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that
are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! On the day of
the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop
and with the help of the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that
you will see on the same evening. So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the
performance and see how it all will turn out!

Courtesy Sleeve is a format originally developed by Mike O'Brien and is an
exploration of movement, ensemble work and organic shifts. A whole world opens
up from a single suggestion and will lead to a series of inspirational scenes
through transitional and bold group work. Come join this jump into a rabbit
hole and experience Improv in one of it's purest forms!

Entrance to the mixer shows is FREE. If you liked what you saw you can leave
a donation to the festival after the show!

Designed to keep the performers permanently "in the moment", Parallel starts as
a simple organic group movement, from which the improvisers emerge into scene work,
without even knowing they are starting a scene..... until the moment they arrive
in it. Whilst someone performs their scene, the group continues around them
in supportive movement. 

Entrance to the mixer shows is FREE. If you liked what you saw you can leave a
donation to the festival after the show!
