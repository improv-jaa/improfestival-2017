### The Moment (FIN/USA) - “Here, Now”

In English

In "Here, Now" Kaisa and Chris spend 45 minutes with you in
real time, drifting in and out of a series of memories, flashbacks,
and prognostications, based on emotional truths from our lives.
There are heaps of joy, delight, and honesty, with teasing and
truthful conversation in equal measure.

---

Kaisa and Chris are both improvisers, instructors, and community leaders - one
in Finland, and one in the USA. They only play together a few times a year, but
it is an annual highlight for both.

In their instruction, both teachers emphasize honesty, vulnerability, truthfulness,
physicality, silence, and genuine fun. Their shows are a reflection of these common interests!

### Rocky Amaretto (NLD) - “Everybody has one”

In English

We all have stories about our fathers, being a father or maybe becoming one.
Rocky Amaretto will play their show ‘Fathers’. Kicking off the show with a true
story surrounding the theme by one of the players,  then opening up the
dialogue with the audience.

Stories from the audience and stories from the players will be translated to the stage.
Sometimes we will find the obvious, sometimes a hidden gem. Sometimes raw,
sometimes hilarious, sometimes dramatic but always fierce. Prepare for a ride.

Cast: Roemer Lievaart, Sven Lanser & Marith Venderbosch
