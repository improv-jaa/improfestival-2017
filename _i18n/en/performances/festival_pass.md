The Fifth Annual Tilt International Improv Festival takes place on
21-23 September at St. Catherine’s Church! Improv differs from
classical theatre in that the entire performance is invented on the
spot, inspired from suggestions given by the audience. Every
performance is unique and will never be seen again, because it's not
possible to improvise the same story twice. Tilt brings you the best
improv actors and teachers from Estonia and all over the world! Tilt:
Theatre like never before! (And also never again.)

Instead of buying tickets one by one it’s also possible to buy a festival
pass that makes seeing performances cheaper than when buying full price
tickets. The number of festival passes is limited. 

Tilt Festival Pass costs 60 euros.
