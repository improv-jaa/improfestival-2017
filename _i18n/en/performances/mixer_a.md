### "Let the Music Play". Instructor: Severin Mahncke

**In English**

The fifth international improv festival Tilt is very
proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away.
Because these participants are skillful at what they do, they are
happy to engage in challenges that are bigger than just improvising
a performance on the spot! On the day of the mixer show, improvisers
with different backgrounds have met in a workshop and with the help
of the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that you
will see on the same evening. So itâ€™s as fresh as it can be! Come to
the performance and see how it all will turn out!

In this format, the scenes and stories are inspired by sounds, sound
atmospheres and instrumental music (and some very few pop songs) that
are randomly picked from a 600-track file on a computer. The improvisers
use what they hear to be inspired, whether geographically, emotionally,
as a character or for a choice of space or time. Every scene begins with
music or a sound. And ends with it as well. Each scene stands for itself,
no ongoing plot is intended.

Entrance to the mixer shows is FREE. If you liked what you saw you can leave
a donation to the festival after the show!
