### “Any Given Day”. Instructor: Feña Ortalli

In English

The fifth international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome
improvisers from countries nearby and far away. Because these participants
are skillful at what they do, they are happy to engage in challenges that
are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! On the day of
the mixer show, improvisers with different backgrounds have met in a workshop
and with the help of the workshop instructor they have prepared the format that
you will see on the same evening. So it’s as fresh as it can be! Come to the
performance and see how it all will turn out!

The performers ask a member of the audience for his/her birthday and then search
on Wikipedia for historical events that took place on that day throughout history.
The group then plays scenes based on some of those events.

Entrance to the mixer shows is FREE. If you liked what you saw you can leave
a donation to the festival after the show!

Where there's people there's stories. In ‘The Place’ we'll go to a specific location
and take a glimpse into the lives of the people we find there. Who will we meet there
at 5 o'clock in the morning on a cloudy Wednesday? What happened there 30 years ago on
the last day of spring at the exact same spot? Make sure you get to ‘The Place’ where
you can be a voyeur, as the performers explore relationships through time and space in
a poetic and dynamic mix, while you sit back and soak up the view.
