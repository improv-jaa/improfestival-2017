The Fifth Annual Tilt International Improv Festival takes place
on 21-23 September at St. Catherine’s Church! Improv differs from
classical theatre in that the entire performance is invented on
the spot, inspired from suggestions given by the audience. Every
performance is unique and will never be seen again, because it's
not possible to improvise the same story twice. Tilt brings you
the best improv actors and teachers from Estonia and all over the
world! Tilt: Theatre like never before! (And also never again.)

This year it is also possible to buy the Tilt Supporter’s Pass.
The Supporter’s Pass is meant for the most dedicated fans of improv
who have already planned these three nights well in advance to see
all the shows in this year’s festival. But the owner of this pass is
not just a fan of improv but he or she is also a fan of the festival
Tilt and feels that this event is important in improv scene both
locally and globally. Thanks to this noble person the organisers of
the festival can feel moral support and encouragement in making the
festival happen as well as real support in paying the bills of the
festival. And also maybe get one extra cup of coffee.

We thank you!

Tilt Supporter’s Pass costs 100 euros.
