### Improteater IMPEERIUM (EST) - "Tell us!" (In Estonian)

We all have had wonderful and surprising moments in our lives, we just have to listen to one another. Improv theater IMPEERIUM offers one audience member a chance to share some of his or hers life. Inspired from that interview the actors of IMPEERIUM will play a story with the main character almost as somebody described in the interview, living through moments almost similar to the ones described before.

Improv theater IMPEERIUM (Empire) was created on 2014 by a group of theater professionals who have done improv already for 8 years. The members of the group are all professional actors, who in addition to being members of IMPEERIUM, are also part of drama groups in other Estonian theaters or work as freelancers in various theater, television and film projects. In addition to actors, there are also musicians and a lighting designer in the group, who help to create worlds full of fantasy on the stage.
The Imperials entertain audiences with performances, create excitement at different events and improve the capability to work together in improv workshops. In improv nobody knows what is going to happen, but everything is possible! The power of imagination is endless!

### Each Other (LAT/FRA) - “Say something” (In English)

Kaspars Breidaks from Latvia and Dan Seyfried from France are two friends who really like to laugh, cry, scream, be crazy, be lovely, and most of all have fun and improvise together. They have performed all around Europe and USA separately and are eager to continue the adventures of their duo to take care of "Each other".
