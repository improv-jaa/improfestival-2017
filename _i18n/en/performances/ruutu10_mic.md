### Ruutu10 (EST) - “T&R”

**In Estonian**

Rauno and Toivo will embark on a journey to
discover how an idea inspires the action and how that
action becomes an exciting storyline. Different characters
dive into captivating twisters of scenic events, not knowing
where it will lead them. Humorous points of views, unexpected
revelations, and gripping relations will surprise us every step
of the way.

Toivo Värbu and Rauno Meronen are improvisers from Ruutu10. They
started their duo show in the spring of 2016. Rauno says: “We did
not have much of a vision about how the format should look like.
Toivo wants more of a TJ & Dave styled slow comedy, whereas I would
like a Middleage Comeback styled sweaty chaos. So we are somewhere
in between, sometimes one way, other times another way.“
