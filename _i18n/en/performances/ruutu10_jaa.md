### Ruutu10 (EST) - “JD” (In Estonian)

JD is a fast paced and fluid long-form with quick and
seamless scene transitions. JD is a free-form improv show​.
Improvisers are on stage having ultimate fun and actively trying
to find the structure of the show. If you have seen a lot of safe
improv, and want to see something with more risk, then you should
call Johnny Depression."

### Jaa !mprov theatre (EST) - “What could go wrong?” (In Estonian)

We all make plans, may they be big or small. “I’ll just hop by the
store quickly before I go home” or “I’ll just peek my crushes Facebook
wall for a moment” or “I’ll finish university studies in time”. Because
what could go wrong. Sometimes nothing does. But sometimes everything does.

And those last ones are the stories Jaa !mprov theatre brings before you.
Because it’s always nice to look at other peoples problems and think that
you might be quite okey yourself.

Jaa !mprov theatre has brought good short- and long-form improvisation
to the audience for more than eight seasons. Our goal is to offer ways of
connecting with stage either through laughter, acknowledgment or viewpoints
that you wouldn’t expect. Everything that happens on the stage is improvised,
every performance is unique and it all depends on you - the good audience!
